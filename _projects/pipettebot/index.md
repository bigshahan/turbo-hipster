<h2>Pipettebot</h2>
<p> The Pipettebot is a low-cost, open-source, automated pipetting robot developed by students at UCLA!</p>
<p> We developed the Pipettebot with the hope that it will increase the accessibility of research, and provide a modular platform for performing repetitive laboratory tasks.</p>
