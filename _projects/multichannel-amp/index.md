<h2>8 channel high gain transimpedance amplifier</h2>

<p>The original implementation of this project was in a electrophysiology laboratory using an Axopatch patch clamp amplifier connected to a Digidata multichannel data acquisition box. This box acquired the Axopatch data but was capable of handling 16 analog input channels, and the pClamp software was capable of displaying and logging the acquired data.

<p> A simple high gain transimpedance amplifier circuit using a low noise op amp (OPA124) and 1G feedback resistor was repeated 8 times on a printed circuit board (PCB) and assembled into a shielding box (which itself is placed inside a Faraday cage) and connected to 8 inputs through a DSub9 connector and the 8 amplified outputs are connected through BNC connectors.
