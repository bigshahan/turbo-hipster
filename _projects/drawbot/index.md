<h2>Drawbot</h2>
<p> The Drawbot is intended to be a low cost, joystick controlled 2-D robot capable of drawing in charcoal, pastel, and ink over large areas </p>
<p> Because the application is art, the motion control hardware can accomodate lower tolerance for position sensitivity, backlash, etc. which allows a lower cost build. </p>
